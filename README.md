# py_diceware

Quick and dirty diceware tool made in python

## How does it work?

I felt like just using ranom.randint() to get numbers between 1,6 was a little too simple, so I took it a step further. The "seed" entered is the number of numbers that will be generated between 1,6 (ex: 100 will generate 100 numbers all between 1 and 6). This list of numbers is then used to randomly pick 5 numbers for the wordlist. This is done however many times you ask, then it spits out the phrase based on the randomly generated numbers.

Is it more random than a real dice roll? Nope. Does it work? Yup. Are you better off using real dice? Probably.
